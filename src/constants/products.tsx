                    Growie connects nature lovers with landowners, enabling them
                    to rent out unused land for the creation of dream gardens.
                    It is more than just a business; it is a movement towards
                    sustainable living, promoting the use of under utilized land
                    for environmental growth. Growie is sustainable because it
                    encourages mindful land use, fosters local agriculture, and
                    strengthens community bonds. The potential for growth is
                    significant, driven by increasing demand for fresh produce
                    as communities become more aware of the harmful pesticides
                    in conventional farming.{" "}

                    This agent provides lending and borrowing of
                    cryptocurrencies from the AAVE pool. AAVE is a Decentralized
                    Finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow
                    cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries. It
                    operates on a peer-to-peer network, providing liquidity and
                    earning interest for lenders while offering collateralized

                    The project involves using an STM32 microcontroller with
                    UART and CAN interfaces, costing $3.09. The TJA1042 CAN
                    transceiver, compatible with 3.3V MCUs, costs $1.77. The RS
                    232 transceiver, compatible with the Roboclaw, costs $2.65.
                    Three debug RGB LEDs with specified forward voltages and
                    resistors, costing $0.45, completing the setup. All devices
                    have matching bit rates above 460 kbps, which meets the data
                    transfer rate requirements of the Roboclaw. The total cost
                    is $7.96.{" "}

                    The Teensy 4.1, featuring an ARM Cortex-M7 processor,
                    manages communication over CAN bus and serial interfaces.
                    Motor controllers, including SPARK MAX and Victor SP, handle
                    brushless and brushed DC motors, with SPARK MAX using CAN
                    bus and Victor SP relying on PWM. Sensors like the MPU-6050
                    for motion tracking, BMP280 for atmospheric pressure and
                    temperature, and HC-SR04 for ultrasonic distance measurement
                    enhance environmental interaction. Communication protocols
                    include I2C for sensor data aggregation and SPI for LCD
                    module communication, ensuring efficient data exchange.
                    WS2812B LEDs provide visual feedback, controlled via PWM,
                    while BOB-12009 modules manage logic level conversion
                    between 3.3V and 5V. An Arduino Nano acts as a supplementary
                    processing unit, communicating serially with the Teensy for
                    expanded functionality.{" "}
